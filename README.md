# Discord Navigator
A small Chrome extension that adds a search bar to your server list on Discord. Type a name, get an instant highlight, and jump right in. No more scrolling through a wall of icons.

## Key Features
+ **Fast server search:** Start typing and every matching server gets outlined in the color you selected.  
+ **Works with long names:** The highlight shows up even if your search term is only part of the full server name.  
+ **Advanced match mode:** Need something looser? Toggle on letter-by-letter matching.  
+ **User-Friendly Interface:** One search box, one clear button, nothing extra.  
+ **Open-Source:** Contribute by opening an issue or submit a pull request.
